# Hotel Informal Program (C# WPF with Microsoft SQL Server)
> Spoiler 'I do not use OOP here due to its a programming base course and the main focus there to lern WPF and Microsoft SQL Server concepts'

The Hotel Informal Program repository houses a comprehensive software solution developed using C# (WPF) and integrated with Microsoft SQL Server. This project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly management system for hotels, streamlining various operations and facilitating efficient day-to-day processes.
### Key Features:
1) User-friendly Interface: The program utilizes Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to deliver an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, ensuring easy navigation and enhanced user experience.
2) Database Integration: The system is seamlessly connected to a Microsoft SQL Server database, allowing for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. The database stores vital information such as guest details, reservations, room availability, billing records, and more.
3) Reservation Management: The program offers comprehensive reservation management capabilities, allowing hotel staff to create, modify, and cancel bookings with ease. It provides real-time room availability status and supports multiple room types, enabling efficient allocation of rooms to guests.
4) Guest Management: The system facilitates the management of guest information, including personal details, contact information, and preferences. It allows for guest check-in and check-out, generating relevant reports and invoices as needed.
5) Billing and Invoicing: The program automates the billing process, calculating charges based on room rates, additional services, and duration of stay. It generates accurate invoices and provides billing history for reference purposes.
6) Reporting and Analytics: The system offers a range of reports and analytics to assist in decision-making and performance evaluation. These reports may include occupancy rates, revenue analysis, guest feedback, and other relevant metrics.
7) Security and Access Control: The software incorporates robust security measures, ensuring secure access and protecting sensitive guest information. It provides role-based access control, allowing different user roles with varying levels of permissions.
8) Customization and Scalability: The codebase is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy customization and scalability to meet specific hotel requirements. It can accommodate additional features or integration with external systems if needed.
